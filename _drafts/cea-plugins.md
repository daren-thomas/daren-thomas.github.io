title: Writing your own CEA plugins
---

The CityEnergyAnalyst consists of a core set of tools and visualizations of the output of those tools. This article is about extending that set with your own. To do that, you need to write a CEA plugin.

- overview
- what can be changed / added / extended?
- the plugin template
  - scripts.yml
  - schemas.yml
  - plots.yml
  - default.config
- how does all this stuff relate to the CEA itself?
- the nitty gritty (what to do if the simple plugin is not enough?)
